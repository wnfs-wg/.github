# Welcome to the WebNative Filesystem (WNFS) Working Group

The Web Native File System (WNFS) is a distributed file system. It is versioned,
logged, programmable, has strong-yet-flexible security, and is fully controlled
by the end user. Service providers can validate writes without reading the
contents of the file system, and minimal metadata is leaked.

WNFS relies heavily on the ‚Äùspace‚Äù side of the space/time trade-off to deliver
performance. As a consequence of this and Merklization, WNFS can provide
advanced functionality such as versioning and delegated or collaborative write
access.

WNFS can be used for offline collaboration, because WNFS forms a state-based
conflict-free replicated data type (CRDT): There exists a commutative and
associative merge function that combines any two (versions of) WNFS roots.

WNFS is content-addressed and thus extremely portable. It may be stored on the
edge, on the end user's device or in the cloud. Devices may also only partially
load a WNFS and still write files and directories.

Please see the [official spec][spec] or [specs](#specs) for more detail.
